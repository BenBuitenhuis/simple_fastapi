# [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) on [DigitalOcean's App Platform](https://m.do.co/c/beef14f5483f)

## What I built

I built a simple FastAPI that will respond with random Yo' Mama! jokes.

### Category Submission:

Random Roulette. Everybody's building a COVID19 app; this is mine. COVID19 got
nothing on a good Yo' Mama joke! Also, I can't program for crap so there's that
as well.

## Background

Building this app is to actually show how to deploy a FastAPI app
to DigitalOcean's App Platform. DigitalOcean has examples of the major Python
webframeworks, but not FastAPI. This post will fix that since I believe that
DigitalOcean's App Platform is ideal for deploying FastAPI super fast.

### How I built it

This course supports financially FastAPI library and will show you how to use FastAPI for it's ultimate purpose. Server ML models. I just use it for Yo Mama jokes and Bob's Burgers hamburger recipes. There's got to be somebody out there who needs that for their ML stuff... Righ???
