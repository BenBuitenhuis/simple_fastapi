## What I built

I built a simple FastAPI that will respond with random Yo' Mama! jokes.

### Category Submission:

**Random Roulette**: Everybody's building a COVID19 app. COVID19 got
nothing on a good Yo' Mama joke! Also, I can't program for crap so there's that as well. One day I'll build a COVID19 FastAPI app. That day ain't today.

### Description

This is a simple FastAPI app that dishes out Yo Mama Jokes in the same vein as dishing out affirmations like [Tilde Thurium](https://twitter.com/annthurium)'s [affirmations](https://www.affirmations.dev/) API.

## Background

Building this app to show how to deploy a FastAPI app
to DigitalOcean's App Platform. DigitalOcean has examples of the major Python web frameworks, but not FastAPI. This post will fix that since I believe that DigitalOcean's App Platform is ideal for deploying FastAPI fast.

### How I built it

Using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework

### Additional Resources/Info

* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): The Official Documentation
* Calmcode.io [FastAPI course](https://calmcode.io/fastapi/hello-world.html):
  Fastest quickstart in the world for FastAPI. Yes, even faster than FastAPI's
official docs. Narrated, written, and coded by
[@fishnets88](https://twitter.com/fishnets88).
* TestDriven.io [FastAPI course](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/?utm_source=mrcartoonster): If you're an actual professional Developer/Programmer, I'm not. This course supports financially FastAPI library and will show you how to use FastAPI for its ultimate purpose. Serving ML models. I just use it for Yo Mama jokes and Bob's Burgers hamburger recipes. There's got to be somebody out there who needs that for their ML stuff... Right???
