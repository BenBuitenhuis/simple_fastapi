# [FastAPI]() and [DigitalOcean's App Platform]()

## What I Built

Built a simple FastAPI app that returns funny, random Yo' Mama jokes.


## Category Submission

Random Roulette


## App Link

[Yo' Mama!](https://fastapi-d-oapp-tjgd2.ondigitalocean.app/)

## Description

This is a basic FastAPI app of random Yo' Mama jokes. That's pretty much it.


## Permissive License

## Background

Built this app because there are not API's for random Yo' Mama jokes. That's a
freaking crime! Also, DigitalOcean doesn't have a quickstart for FastAPI apps
as well. That's a crime too.
